copy server.js 
Task 1 - build the package.json file
You need to look at server.js to see what libraries to build
Do you remember how to build an empty package.json initially - use npm  ????

Task 2 - How do you run Node with server.js ? Check out that it works?

Task 3 - run server.js using npm start - how is that working?

Task 4 - Download Docker - make sure its running by checking its version

We will now build a docker image to run our Express Web Server
